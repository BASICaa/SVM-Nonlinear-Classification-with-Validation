# SVM Nonlinear Classification with Validation

This repository contains scripts for training and visualizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The model is trained on a non-linear dataset and includes a validation step to optimize hyperparameters. This project is a Python conversion of an Octave project from Stanford University's Machine Learning course.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `scipy`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `pandas`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install scipy numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib pandas
